# NPDS Tracker Server

A Java based server for tracking and listing [Newton Personal Data Sharing](http://npds.free.fr/) clients.

The NPDS Tracker Server was originally developed by [Victor Rehorst](http://www.chuma.org/) and [Paul Guyot](http://kallisys.com/), with additional contributions by [Morgan Aldridge](http://makkintosshu.com/), [Grant Hutchinson](http://splorp.com/), [Ron Parker](http://quadzilla.net/), and Manuel Probsthain.

Many thanks to [Matt Vaughn](http://chromatin.cshl.edu/vaughn/) for developing NPDS in the first place.

## Requirements

### Java 1.1 or later

Java 1.3 or later is highly recommended due to DNS caching bugs in prior versions of the runtime. If you must use Java 1.1 or 1.2, there is a workaround for this caching bug. Add the parameter ```-Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=0``` to the Java command-line.

The current release of the NPDS Tracker Server has been tested with Java SE versions 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6.

The Java SE (Standard Edition) runtime can be downloaded from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/).

### An internet connection

The NPDS Tracker Server uses TCP port 3680, as assigned by [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml).

Trackers may also be configured to also listen on port 80 or 8080.

### A text editor

For editing the various configuration and template files.
	
	
## Files

```readme.md``` — You’re soaking in it

```npdstracker.java``` — Tracker server Java source code

```npdstracker.ini``` — Tracker server settings and configuration

```template.html``` — Tracker server page template

```template.css``` — Tracker server page stylesheet

```npdscmd.txt``` — Initial tracker server commands. Registered servers are written to this file upon shutdown

```startnpds.sh``` — An example startup script for *NIX-like operating systems
	
```manifest.mf``` — Information specific to the Java source code
	

## Basic Configuration

* Assuming you already have the Java SDK or runtime set up properly, open a command line and compile the server:

```javac npdstracker.java```

* Edit ```npdstracker.ini``` and change any settings you see fit. Pay attention to the log settings - NPDS Tracker Server logs are rather verbose and can become quite large over time. You can turn off the logging once you are sure that your server is configured properly. You can also add any tracker servers that you want to share records with.

* Start the server at the command line:

```java npdstracker```

or, for Java 1.2.x:

```java -Dsun.net.inetaddr.ttl=0 npdstracker```

* Test connecting to the server. Fire up a web browser and point it to

```http://<server IP/hostname>:3680/```

* Configure and NPDS server to point to the tracker and make sure it can register.


## Advanced Configuration

The basic configuration is great for development, testing, and Windows deployment, but for those running Linux or Mac OS X, it’s preferable to install the NPDS Tracker Server more permanently and appropriately.

+ For a cleaner installation, create a JAR file at the command line:

```jar cvfm npdstracker.jar manifest.fm *.class```

+ Install the JAR file to ```/usr/local/bin``` from at the command line:

```mkdir -p /usr/local/bin```
```install npdstracker.jar /usr/local/bin```

+ Install the ```npdstracker.ini``` and ```npdscmd.txt``` files in ```/etc``` at the command line:

```mkdir -p /etc/npdstracker```
```install npdstracker.ini npdscmd.txt /etc/npdstracker```

+ Install the ```template.html``` and ```template.css``` files in ```/usr/local/share``` at the command line:

```mkdir -p /usr/local/share/npdstracker```
```install template.html template.css /usr/local/share/npdstracker```

+ Create the log file at the command line:

```touch /var/log/npdstracker.log```

+ Edit ```/etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini``` to point to the new paths for all the aforementioned files, especially:

```pageTemplate = /usr/local/share/npdstracker/template.html```
```cssTemplate = /usr/local/share/npdstracker/template.css```
```logfile = /var/log/npdstracker.log```

+ You can now manually start the NPDS Tracker Server at the command line:

```java -jar /usr/local/bin/npdstracker.jar -c /etc/npdstracker/npdscmd.txt -o /etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini```

+ On Darwin or Mac OS X, you can create a launch daemon to automatically start the NPDS Tracker Server on boot by creating and editing ```/Library/LaunchDaemons/fr.free.npds.npdstracker.plist``` and pasting in the following (this is assuming following the above Advanced Configuration steps):

```	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	<plist version="1.0">
		<dict>
			<key>Label</key>
			<string>fr.free.npds.npdstracker</string>
			<key>ProgramArguments</key>
			<array>
				<string>java</string>
				<string>-jar</string>
				<string>/usr/local/bin/npdstracker.jar</string>
				<string>-c</string>
				<string>/etc/npdstracker/npdscmd.txt</string>
				<string>-o</string>
				<string>/etc/npdstracker/npdstracker.ini</string>
			</array>
			<key>KeepAlive</key>
			<dict>
				<key>NetworkState</key>
				<true/>
			</dict>
			<key>RunAtLoad</key>
			<true/>
		</dict>
	</plist>```

It can be loaded immediately by running the following at the command line, or you can wait until the next reboot:

```sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/fr.free.npds.npdstracker.plist```

+ On Linux or BSD systems, you can create ```init.d``` or ```rc.d``` scripts, respectively, to automatically start the NPDS Tracker Server on boot.



## Page Template Tag Syntax

The HTML template (```template.html```) can be customized using the following pseudo-SGML tags to insert information into the page.

```<hit-counter/>``` — The number of hits since last restart

```<http-doc/>``` — What comes after the GET (usually “/”)

```<last-validation/>``` — The date and time of the last validation or “Validation is in progress.”

```<meta-refresh/>``` — The meta element containing the http-equiv="refresh" value

```<servers/>``` — The list of NPDS servers formatted as a table

```<server-counter/>``` — The number of registered NPDS servers

```<stylesheet/>``` — Inserts the stylesheet as specified in npdstracker.ini (default: template.css)

```<trackerHost/>``` — The URL of the host site or server as specified in npdstracker.ini

```<trackerName/>``` — The name of the host site or server as specified in npdstracker.ini

```<url/>``` - The URL of this server, obtained by reading the HTTP header

```<validate-time/>``` — The time (in minutes) between validations

```<version/>``` - The current version of the tracker software
